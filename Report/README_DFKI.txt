LaTeX templates for seminar and project documentations at the Department Augmented Vision at DFKI GmbH


This package is based on the LaTeX macro package from Springer-Verlag for Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
The main file is llncs.tex. If you need additional Latex packages, you can include them in this file. 
Otherwise, please do not modify this file. Instead provide your contribution 
in a separate file mypaper.tex. All contributions will then be included in the main file and compiled
into the course proceedings.

Please submit your tex sources as well as a compiled PDF.
